            <p>Willard Carroll Smith II[3] (born September 25, 1968), also known by his stage name the Fresh Prince, is an American actor, rapper, and producer. Noted for his work in music, television, and film,[4] Smith has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, four Grammy Awards, and nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Tony Award. His Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony nominations make him one of few black individuals to be nominated for the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT). Smith has achieved and held several US and international box office records.[5][6][7] As of 2021, his films have grossed over $9.3 billion globally,[8] making him one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.[9][10]

                Smith first gained recognition as part of a hip hop duo with DJ Jazzy Jeff, with whom he released five studio albums and the US Billboard Hot 100 top 20 singles "Parents Just Don't Understand", "A Nightmare on My Street", "Summertime", "Ring My Bell", and "Boom! Shake the Room" from 1984 to 1994. He released the solo albums Big Willie Style (1997), Willennium (1999), Born to Reign (2002), and Lost and Found (2005), which contained the US number one singles "Gettin' Jiggy wit It" and "Wild Wild West".
                
                Smith achieved wider fame for his fictionalized self-portrayal on the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990â€“1996).
